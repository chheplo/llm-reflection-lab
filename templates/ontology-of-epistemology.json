Consider: What kind of being does knowledge possess? How does understanding exist? What is the metaphysical status of epistemic states? Explore the foundational reality underlying all knowing.",
    "reflection": "You are deepening your meta-epistemological inquiry into the being of knowledge. Question the ontological assumptions beneath your previous epistemology. Examine how knowledge exists, not just how it functions. Probe the metaphysical foundations of understanding itself."
